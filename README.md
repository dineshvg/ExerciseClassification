# ExerciseClassification
Classification of Doppler signals of 20Khz obtained from android devices into different exercises using Signal processing and machine learning techniques

### AudioGest

```sh
1. Implementation of the AudioGest paper for signal processing.
2. Obtaining the signal and filtering it using a bandpass filter.
3. Using techniques of frequency normalization and audio signal segmentation on top of it.
4. Finally smoothening the signal using a guassian filter.
```

### Machine learning

```sh
1. Currenly doing interpolation and extrapolation of the signal to obtain equal sized signals to be used in the sliding window which will be used to extract features from the signal.
```

### TODO

1. Feature extraction.
2. Binary classification using SVM.
3. Try various classification techniques on top of it.
4. Historical data analysis of the user on top of his own signal.
